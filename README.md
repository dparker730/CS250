I implement user needs into a program by first gathering information from meetings with core groups of stakeholders using the product. Once enough information is gathered, we can start to develop user stories. These will help the team break down the desired functions into manageable pieces to be tested. Once a function is tested and works properly, the team can start to develop them into the product for release to the customers.
The approach to developing a program begins by understanding why the customer would use certain functions. When the team understands what the customer wants, they can develop a useful and successful product. An agile principle that I hope to incorporate into my future development work is that the primary focus is on customer need facilitated by constant improvement of customer experience. 
To be a good team member in software development, it is important to remain flexible during each stage of the product lifecycle so that a change in any direction will be more achievable. Communication is key to success in this process. A team with clear and concise communication can develop a product with more focus and agility, with lower cost, and with lower risk for the company.
